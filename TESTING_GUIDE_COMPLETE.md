# Complete Testing Guide: Image Asset Pipeline Diagnostics

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Status:** ✅ All 5 diagnostic patches applied and built

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Reload Extension (REQUIRED)

The extension was just rebuilt with diagnostics. Chrome needs to reload it:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Web to Figma" extension
3. Click **Reload** button (circular arrow)

### 2. Capture Test Page

Open test file: `file:///Users/skirk92/figmacionvert-2/test-images-simple.html`

This has 3 simple images (400x300 each):
- Unsplash photo
- Picsum random photo
- Placeholder.com

**Steps:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Click extension icon → "Capture Page"
4. **Watch the console output carefully**

## What to Look For: The 5 Diagnostic Checkpoints

### ✅ Checkpoint 1: Asset Creation (Injected Script)

**File:** `injected-script.ts:129`
**When:** Right after extraction completes, before sending to background

**Expected Log:**
```
✅ [INJECT] extractPageToSchema() returned successfully
✅ [INJECT] Schema structure: {nodes: 'present', assets: 3}
```

**What it means:**
- `assets: 3` = Assets created successfully in memory
- `assets: 0` = Asset creation failed (images not being captured)

**If assets: 0** → Issue is in `dom-extractor.ts` image capture logic

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 2: Asset Finalization (DOM Extractor)

**File:** `dom-extractor.ts:10445`
**When:** After all images captured, before sending to injected script

**Expected Log:**
```
📊 [ASSET VALIDATION] Finalized 3 image assets
  📸 Asset img_abc123...:
     - hasData: false
     - hasBase64: false
     - hasUrl: true
     - url: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...
     - dimensions: 400x300
  📸 Asset img_def456...:
     ...
  📸 Asset img_ghi789...:
     ...
⚠️ [ASSET VALIDATION] ALL 3 images are URL-only (no embedded base64)
   Plugin MUST fetch via proxy. Ensure handoff server is running at http://localhost:4411
```

**What it means:**
- Shows asset count and structure
- `hasUrl: true` = Fallback URL is available
- `hasBase64: false` = No embedded data (URL-only mode, requires proxy)

**If no log appears** → `finalizeAssets` not being called

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 3: Serialization Check (Background Script)

**File:** `background.ts:2766` (NEW!)
**When:** Right before JSON.stringify in background script

**Expected Log:**
```
📊 [BACKGROUND SERIALIZATION] About to serialize schema:
   - Images: 3
   - SVGs: 0
   - Has assets object: true
   - Has assets.images: true
```

**OR if assets missing:**
```
⚠️ [BACKGROUND SERIALIZATION] NO IMAGES IN ASSETS! Schema will be incomplete.
```

**What it means:**
- **Images: 3** = Assets made it from injected script → background script
- **Images: 0** = Assets lost in postMessage between scripts

**If Images: 0 but Checkpoint 1 showed assets: 3** → postMessage is stripping assets

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 4: Plugin Import Validation

**File:** `enhanced-figma-importer.ts:522`
**When:** When plugin starts importing the JSON

**Steps to see this:**
1. After capture, find the JSON file: `ls -t page-capture-*.json | head -1`
2. Open Figma desktop app
3. Open plugin console: Plugins → Development → Open Console
4. Load the JSON and click "Import"
5. Watch the plugin console

**Expected Log:**
```
📊 [IMPORT VALIDATION] Checking assets structure...
  Assets validation: {hasAssets: true, hasImages: true, imageCount: 3, ...}
  📸 Sample asset hashes: ['img_abc123...', 'img_def456...', 'img_ghi789...']
  📊 Sample asset structure: {hasData: false, hasBase64: false, hasUrl: true, url: '...'}
⚠️ [IMPORT VALIDATION] Assets are URL-only (no embedded data)
   Ensure handoff server proxy is running at http://localhost:4411
```

**OR if assets missing:**
```
❌ [IMPORT VALIDATION] NO IMAGES IN ASSETS! This will cause all images to fail.
   Check extension console for asset finalization logs.
```

**What it means:**
- **imageCount: 3** = Assets made it into the JSON file
- **imageCount: 0** = Assets not saved to file

**If Checkpoint 3 showed Images: 3 but this shows imageCount: 0** → File writing/server storage issue

---

### ✅ Checkpoint 5: Hash Lookup

**File:** `node-builder.ts:6044`
**When:** For each image during import, if lookup fails

**Expected Log (if hash found):**
```
🖼️ [FIGMA IMPORT] Resolving image paint for hash: img_abc123...
  📁 Found asset for hash img_abc123...
  📊 Asset details: hasBase64=false, url=https://...
  ✅ Successfully created image from asset
```

**OR if hash not found:**
```
🖼️ [FIGMA IMPORT] Resolving image paint for hash: img_abc123...
  ⚠️ No asset found for hash img_abc123...
  🔍 [HASH MISMATCH DEBUG] Comparing hash formats:
     Requested hash: img_abc123... (length: 15)
     Sample asset key: img_abc123... (length: 15)
```

**What it means:**
- Hash lookup worked → Assets are properly keyed
- Hash mismatch → Extension and plugin use different hash algorithms (unlikely)

## Failure Scenario Matrix

| Checkpoint | Result | Root Cause | Fix |
|------------|--------|------------|-----|
| 1 | assets: 0 | Images not captured | Check `captureImageSafe` in dom-extractor.ts |
| 2 | No log | `finalizeAssets` not called | Check extraction flow |
| 2 | Assets logged | Assets created OK | Continue to next checkpoint |
| 3 | Images: 0 | postMessage stripping | Check message size limits |
| 3 | Images: 3 | Serialization OK | Continue to next checkpoint |
| 4 | imageCount: 0 | File/server issue | Check JSON file and handoff server |
| 4 | imageCount: 3 | Assets in JSON | Continue to next checkpoint |
| 5 | Hash mismatch | Hashing inconsistent | Fix hash algorithm (unlikely) |
| 5 | Hash found | Lookup OK | Check proxy and URL fetch |

---

## Expected Timeline

Based on checkpoint results, the issue will be in one of these layers:

### Layer 1: Asset Creation (Checkpoints 1-2)
- **If fails here:** Image capture logic broken
- **Probability:** Low (code looks correct)

### Layer 2: Message Passing (Checkpoint 3)
- **If fails here:** postMessage size limits or structured clone issue
- **Probability:** Medium (assets might be too large)

### Layer 3: Serialization/Storage (Checkpoint 4)
- **If fails here:** JSON.stringify or file/server writing issue
- **Probability:** High (existing captures have no assets)

### Layer 4: Plugin Import (Checkpoints 4-5)
- **If fails here:** Hash mismatch or proxy fetch issue
- **Probability:** Low (code looks correct)

---

## Post-Test Actions

### If Assets are in Schema at Checkpoint 3 but Missing in JSON (Checkpoint 4)

This means the issue is in JSON.stringify or file/server storage. Check:

1. **JSON.stringify behavior:**
   ```bash
   # Test if JSON.stringify preserves assets
   node -e "
   const obj = {assets: {images: {'img_123': {url: 'test'}}}};
   const str = JSON.stringify(obj);
   const parsed = JSON.parse(str);
   console.log('Has assets:', !!parsed.assets);
   console.log('Has images:', !!parsed.assets?.images);
   "
   ```

2. **File size limits:**
   - Check if JSON file is truncated
   - Check Chrome download limits

3. **Handoff server storage:**
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Check if server strips large objects

### If Assets are Missing at Checkpoint 3

This means postMessage is losing the assets. Possible causes:

1. **Structured clone limits:** Assets too large for cloning
2. **Message size limits:** Chrome has 64MB message limit
3. **Circular references:** Though sanitization should prevent this

**Fix:** Stream assets separately or use IndexedDB instead of postMessage

---

## Success Criteria

**✅ All checkpoints pass:** Images should render in Figma

**Expected output sequence:**
```
1. [INJECT] Schema structure: {assets: 3}        ← Assets created
2. [ASSET VALIDATION] Finalized 3 image assets   ← Assets finalized
3. [BACKGROUND SERIALIZATION] Images: 3          ← Assets serialized
4. [IMPORT VALIDATION] imageCount: 3             ← Assets in JSON
5. [FIGMA IMPORT] Successfully created image     ← Images rendered
```
